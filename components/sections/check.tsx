      How Much Does Rent a Luxury Car in Dubai Cost?

      </h3>
      <p className="text-xl-medium neutral-500">
     In Dubai, you will find many car rental options. However, at Legendary Car Rental, we provide you with affordable rental prices.
	  Therefore, our price range ranges from the most inexpensive to the most luxurious and powerful options. 
	   It ranges from AED 500 to AED 6000 and more. However, the prices keep fluctuating due to several factors, including:
			<br/><strong>Brand and Model</strong><br/>
			The brand and model of the car have the most impact on the rental price. 
			Moreover, the type of vehicle also impacts its rent price. 
			For example, if you want a sports car, its rental cost will be higher than a luxury sedan. 
			Besides, brands like Rolls Royce, Ferrari, and Lamborghini are more expensive than Mercedes, Audi, and BMW. 
			Also, the latest models have more prices than the older ones.

     	Factors to Consider While Choosing Luxury Car Rental Dubai
      </h3>
      <p className="text-xl-medium neutral-500">
		Renting a luxury car in Dubai is easy with Legendary Car Rental. 
		With a vast fleet of vehicles, we offer you the right option.
		 You don’t need to search for other luxury car rental companies with us. However, 
		if you insist on searching for them, here are some significant points to notice: 
      </p>
	  <h4 className="mb-2 neutral-1000 custom-heading5">
		Choose the Brand Carefully
      </h4>
	  <p className="text-xl-medium neutral-500">
		Self-reflection is the most important thing before renting a car in Dubai. 
		Go for the brand and model with which you are familiar or confident in your driving skills.
		 You might need good driving skills for the super and sports cars from Lamborghini, Ferrari, Porsche, and McLaren.

      </p>
	   <h4 className="mb-2 neutral-1000 custom-heading5">
		Consider Your Purpose

      </h4>
	  <p className="text-xl-medium neutral-500">
		Be clear about your needs and the purpose of your visit. 
		You might need different cars for different events and activities. 
		You might be in trouble if you rent a sedan and go on a desert safari.
		 The same goes for sports cars; if you want to make mighty drifts in the bustling markets of Dubai, it doesn’t make sense. 
		 Therefore, ensure you get the right vehicle that serves the purpose.

      </p>
	     <h4 className="mb-2 neutral-1000 custom-heading5">
		Luxury Car Rental Company

      </h4>
	  <p className="text-xl-medium neutral-500">
		Choose a reputable luxury car rental company in Dubai with good reviews and response timing.
		 It’s best to take quotes from different companies and choose the right one.
		  Besides, transparency matters; make sure the company has any hidden charges.
		   Our luxury car rental company's criteria are simple, and pricing is transparent. 
		   Moreover, our customer service is available 24/7 to offer your assistance at any time.
      </p>
	  <h4 className="mb-2 neutral-1000 custom-heading5">
		Hidden Charges

      </h4>
	  <p className="text-xl-medium neutral-500">
		Almost all the companies charge for extra mileage. Besides, the company might charge you extra if you have some extra demands. 
		However, the best practice is to clarify things and pay strictly for the services you will take. 
		Additionally, many luxurious car rentals in Dubai have hidden charges. So, talk it out first and then go for rent.
